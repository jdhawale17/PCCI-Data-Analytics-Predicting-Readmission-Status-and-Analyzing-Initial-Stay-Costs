# PCCI-Data-Analytics-Predicting-Readmission-Status-and-Analyzing-Initial-Stay-Costs
 This project uses data analytics to predict patient readmission status and analyze the costs associated with their initial hospital stay. By leveraging healthcare data, the model provides insights to optimize patient care and reduce readmission rates, improving both clinical outcomes and hospital efficiency.


Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to predict patient readmission status and assess the cost of their initial hospital stay. The primary goal is to use data analytics to enhance hospital efficiency and improve patient care by identifying factors that influence readmission rates and hospital costs. In collaboration with a local health institution, this project aims to provide actionable insights through machine learning models that can drive data-driven decisions in healthcare operations.

Problem Statement
Hospitals face significant challenges in managing patient care efficiently, especially when it comes to reducing readmission rates and managing healthcare costs. By predicting which patients are at high risk for readmission and analyzing the costs associated with initial stays, hospitals can improve patient outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and lower costs. This project uses data analytics to develop predictive models that can help healthcare providers achieve these goals.

Data Exploration and Preparation
The dataset used in this project is a large healthcare dataset provided by a local health institution. It contains various features, including patient demographics, medical history, diagnosis information, length of stay, and costs associated with initial hospitalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Data Handling: We first identified and handled missing values using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal based on the type and importance of the data.
Data Cleaning: We removed any outliers or erroneous data points that could skew the analysis, ensuring that only valid data was used in the models.
Feature Engineering: Several new features were derived from existing columns, such as age groups, the length of stay categories, and cost brackets, to better represent the underlying data patterns.
Visualizations: We used various plots, such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices, to identify relationships between features and the target variables (readmission status and cost).
Key Findings from EDA
Certain patient demographics and medical history factors were strongly correlated with higher readmission rates.
The length of stay and specific diagnosis codes were significant predictors of the cost of the initial stay.
Some features required extensive preprocessing to handle categorical data and ensure compatibility with the machine learning models.
Modeling and Algorithms
We applied a combination of classification and regression algorithms to develop predictive models for the two main objectives:

Predicting Readmission Status (Classification):
This task aimed to predict whether a patient would be readmitted within 30 days based on their medical and demographic information. We tested several classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Predicting Cost of Initial Stay (Regression):
The goal here was to predict the total cost of the patientâ€™s initial hospital stay based on various factors. Regression models were built and tested, such as:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Model Building and Testing
Model Training: We split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the models. Cross-validation was used to ensure that the models generalize well to new data and to avoid overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search and random search techniques were used to optimize the hyperparameters of each model, improving their accuracy and performance.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the classification models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. For the regression models, we evaluated performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Key Insights and Results
The Random Forest Classifier yielded the best results for predicting readmission status, with high recall and precision.
The XGBoost Regressor provided the most accurate predictions for the cost of the initial stay, significantly reducing the error compared to the baseline model.
Feature importance analysis revealed that variables such as age, comorbidities, and length of stay were key drivers of both readmission and cost.
Collaboration with Health Institution
Throughout the project, we worked closely with a local health institution to ensure that the models and insights were practical and aligned with real-world needs. The collaboration focused on:

Identifying the most relevant features for predicting readmission and costs based on hospital priorities.
Implementing the models in a test environment to ensure that the predictions could be used for operational decision-making.
Discussing the results and providing recommendations to optimize hospital operations, improve patient care, and reduce readmission rates.
Conclusion and Future Work
This project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in healthcare. By accurately predicting readmission status and analyzing the costs of initial stays, hospitals can take a proactive approach to improve patient care, reduce operational costs, and optimize resource allocation.

Future Enhancements:
Incorporating additional data sources, such as patient follow-up visits and treatment plans, to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
Developing real-time models that can be integrated into hospital workflows for dynamic decision-making.
Expanding the scope to include predictive models for other healthcare outcomes, such as patient mortality and treatment effectiveness.
